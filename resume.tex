        \section{Work Experience}
            {\sl Software Engineer, Streamer Team Lead} \hfill June 2013 - Present \\ % Team Lead?
            Aereo Inc, Boston, MA
                \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt % reduce space between items
                    \item Led team of four to maintain and add features to the \\
                          Aereo custom Streamer, written in C++ and Python, which \\
                          served all video streams to clients on multiple platforms
                    \item Dictated release schedules and features for the Aereo \\
                          Streamer team, while carrying out packaging and releasing \\
                          of the Streamer software to the release team
                    \item Improved streaming performance for HLS-based clients by implementing \\
                          an O(log n) video binary search algorithm in C++ that supplanted \\
                          an O(n) linear search. Further increased performance by moving \\
                          to an O(1) time stamp data structure with file system caching of indices
                \end{itemize}

            {\sl Software Development Intern} \hfill Summer 2012 \\
            Innovative Software Engineering, Iowa City, IA
                \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt % reduce space between items
                    \item Developed Extensive Web Browser Automation Suite in Java \\
                          and Selenium for use by the Validation Department, with \\
                          rigorous logging and automated email messages, which \\
                          reduced manual testing time and dramatically increased \\
                          overall test coverage
                    \item Implemented rapid development tools for QA staff who lacked \\ 
                          programming experience 
                \end{itemize}

            % {\sl Student Staff Member} \hfill May 2011 - May 2013
            % The National Advanced Driving Simulator, Iowa City, IA
            %     \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt % reduce space between items
            %         \item Wrote Visual Basic .NET programs to efficiently interpret \\
            %               vehicle data from multiple asynchronous sources numbering \\
            %               in the millions of lines, while presenting this data on a \\
            %               synchronized video stream
            %         \item Designed and built a small, accurate, and easily \\
            %               modifiable driving simulator
            %         \item Created an embedded microcontroller and transceiver \\
            %               device with C capable of listening to a vehicleâ€™s data \\
            %               bus and controlling select subsystems
            %     \end{itemize}
