                    \item Designed a certification process which enabled teams at Salsify, including \\
                          my own, to validate that our focus on improved scalability was working, \\

        \section{Work Experience}
            {\sl Software Engineer, Streamer Team Lead} \hfill June 2013 - Present \\ % Team Lead?
            Aereo Inc, Boston, MA
                \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt % reduce space between items
                    \item Led team of four to maintain and add features to the \\
                          Aereo custom Streamer, written in C++ and Python, which \\
                          served all video streams to clients on multiple platforms
                    \item Dictated release schedules and features for the Aereo \\
                          Streamer team, while carrying out packaging and releasing \\

                    \item Improved streaming performance for HLS-based clients by implementing \\
                          an O(log n) video binary search algorithm in C++ that supplanted \\
                          an O(n) linear search. Further increased performance by moving \\
                          to an O(1) time stamp data structure with file system caching of indices
